Anosmia (loss of smell) is a symptom of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 binds tightly to human cells.
The COVID-19 virus can live on surfaces for days.
People with type A blood may be more susceptible to infection.
Reinfection of COVID-19 may be possible.
COVID-19 has greatly boosted the popularity of video games, particularly games that feature online multiplayer features.
The CoronaVirus title is the name of a family of viruses (there are about 40 of them), which bear resemblance with the solar corona due to the spinous crests.
The term "new coronavirus" (novel or nCoV) means that before neither scientists nor the cells met this virus before.
On average, each carrier of a new coronavirus manages to infect 2 to 4 healthy people. This number is higher than seasonal flu (1.3), but lower than measles (12+).
In the age group of 70+, mortality exceeds 5%; 80+, every tenth dies of the virus.
Sneezing is NOT a symptom of coronavirus, but coughing is.
Approximately one in five or six cases require hospitalization, this is true mainly for the elderly and/or those with previous chronic diseases.
Antibiotics are useless against the Coronavirus.
On plastic and steel surfaces, SARS-CoV-2 remains dangerous for up to three days, on paper and cardboard - up to a day, on copper - up to four hours.
In the air, the coronavirus remains viable for three hours.
The Coronavirus can be picked up in an absolutely empty room, where the infected had previously been present.
It makes sense to wear a mask for those who are afraid to infect others. It does not provide 100% protection, but slightly reduces the risk to others.
When coughing from an infected patient, the smallest drops of saliva fly off, each of which may contain billions (!) of virus particles.
It is not exactly known where SARS-CoV-2 came from, but bats and pangolins carry viruses similar to this one.
The mortality rate from Covid-19 is still difficult to calculate with accuracy, but most studies estimate it at 1-3%.
